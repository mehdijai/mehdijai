# 👨‍💻 Welcome, my friend!

_Let me introduce myself 🙋‍♂️_

I'm Mehdi Jai, a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a passion for creating quality software. I started coding as a hobby at 16, and since then, it's become my craft. Over the last two years, I’ve gained professional experience in startups, working on scalable, secure, and performant applications.  

## 🛠 What I Do  
- **Backend Development**: Proficient in **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, focusing on secure and scalable APIs with an eye for architecture and engineering.  
- **Frontend Development**: Building sleek, desktop-first interfaces with modern tools like **VueJS**, **SASS**, **TypeScript**, and sometimes **React/Next.js**.  
- **DevOps**: Slight experience and a big interest in **Docker**, system architecture, automations and secure deployments.  
- **Database Management**: Skilled in **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and Node.js ORMs like **TypeORM** and **PrismaJS**.  

## 🌱 Learning & Goals  
- Diving deeper into the **Node.js** world to expand my backend expertise.  
- Exploring new challenges in security and scalability through engineering and system design.  
- Building stuff from scratch—because why not!
